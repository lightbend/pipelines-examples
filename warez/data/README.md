# Test data generators

## Generated data
Generates formatted Json documents to use as test data for the warez test application.

The generated data is self-consistent:
* The UUIDs for the products are chosen from `data/uuids.txt`.
* The UUIDs for the SKUs are generated by replacing the 2 last charaters of the product UUID it is associated to with `aa` or `bb`.
* The base list of UUID has been checked to ensure that all SKU's UUIDs are unique.
* The keywords for the products are chosen from `data/keywords.txt`.

Additional information:
* Prices in the generated PriceUpdates are between 1 and 1999.
* Stock diff in the generated StockUpdates are between -10 and 10.
* Product names and description are generated by combining 5 letters words chosen from `data/5-letters-words.txt`.
